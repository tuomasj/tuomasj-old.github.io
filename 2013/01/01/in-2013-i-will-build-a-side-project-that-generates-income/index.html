<h1>In 2013, I Will Build a Side Project that Generates Income</h1>
<p>This is my only New Year&rsquo;s resolution.
I will build a side project that generates monthly recurring income.
I try to write blog posts each week describing how I am doing and what I have learned.</p>

<h2>What I Really Want to Learn is Internet Marketing</h2>

<p>I have been programming since I was a kid. I have done web development since late 90&rsquo;s. I have all technical skills to build a web product.</p>

<p>What I want to learn is Internet Marketing. I know lots about it. I have read lots of blog posts and books about the subject, but it&rsquo;s all theoretical information.
I need to start doing it so I actually learn about it.</p>

<p>To get recurring income, I need to build a solution that solves a problem for someone. The solution must be good enough so I can ask money for it.
But I need people to know about my solution. Thats why I need to learn internet marketing.</p>

<p>This is my plan for 2013. Stay tuned and wish me luck :)</p>
