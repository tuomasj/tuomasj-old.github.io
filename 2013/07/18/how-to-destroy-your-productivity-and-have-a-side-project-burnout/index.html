<h1>How to Destroy Your Productivity and Have a Side Project Burnout</h1>
<p>I made a new year resolution to build a side project that generates revenue. My plan was to blog about it every week and write heroic stories about my progress.</p>

<p>I have very limited hours to spend on my side projects per week due to the fact I have a day job which is the best job I have ever had. I like building digital stuff so much, that I have mana left after work to spend on my own projects. But since I already work with software products and projects at my day job, my hobby projects need to be fun. If they start causing me any pain, what&rsquo;s the point having a hobby related so close to my day job?</p>

<p>I need to spend my scarce hours on tasks that help me reach my goal. I cannot work hard, so I need to work smart. I want to maximize my productivity through positivity. There is no room for negativity.</p>

<p>I promised to myself to write a blog post every week because it would be fun. Now, blogging does not come naturally for me. I can force myself to write couple of blog posts, but when I have to repeatedly force myself to write a blog post every week, the &ldquo;fun&rdquo;-part starts to fade away. Yes, I envy people who can write every day. Why on earth I thought forcing myself to blog every week would be fun?</p>

<p>Every time I had spare time to work on my hobby projects, my productivity plummeted. I wasn&rsquo;t focused anymore. I kept thinking about my blogging. I stopped working smart. I forgot to commit my code. My commits became a ugly big ball of mess, with stupid commit messages. Things I currently worked on started to feel disgusting, old and bloated. What is the smartest move in that situation? You start building another idea into a product!</p>

<p>After few weeks you realize that it is a beast of it&rsquo;s own and you start second guessing. What if I had focused on the original project, would it be almost ready by now? That is the feared &ldquo;grass is greener on the other hobby project&rdquo; illusion.</p>

<p>Once you have several small projects going on at the same time, you start paying the price of a context switch. It just takes too much time and energy to pick up where you left last time and get into full speed. I think forcing myself to blog and several small projects going nowhere were the factors that caused my little burnout.</p>

<p>Luckily, my little side project burnout did not affect on my work or my personal life, I just forgot to do the right things right and I wrote bad code, slowly.</p>

<p>Setting some boundaries in the beginning was a very smart move. As soon as I realized things were not fun anymore and how it was affecting my hobby project, I had no problem of making some cuts. Blogging was one of the major sources of my agony, so I decided to take a break from it. Since I had decided the boundaries, I didn&rsquo;t had to fight it with myself. I was allowed to take break from blogging and I abandonned the projects.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t stopped my hobby projects but I have slowed my pace a bit. I still want to create a side project that hopefully would make some revenue and learn cool stuff while doing it. But I cannot do it if I am not smart about it. What I have understood more clearly is the inspiration is the king. When it kicks in, stop messing around and work smart. Maximize the effect of your inspiration.</p>
