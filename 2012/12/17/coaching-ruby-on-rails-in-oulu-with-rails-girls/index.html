<h1>Coaching Ruby on Rails in Oulu with Rails Girls</h1>
<p>I was one of the coaches in first <a href="http://www.railsgirls.com/oulu">Rails Girls</a> event in Oulu.
The idea of Rails Girls is to teach programming for beginners. I&rsquo;ve been using Ruby on Rails since version 1.1 and from there learned Ruby as well. When the organizers <a href="http://www.ouluses.fi">OuluSES</a> asked me to be one of the coaches, it was a no-brainer.</p>

<p>During the event, the focus is on doing. There are just few presentations
to get show started, rest of the time the participants learn by doing.</p>

<h2>Why You Should Coach at a Programming Event?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been programming since late 80&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;ve gone through lots of programming languages and written software on many platforms.
I think it&rsquo;s safe to say I&rsquo;m an expert.</p>

<p>But when I try to explain simple programming concept without using any programming terms,
relying only on common language and real life analogies, my expertise does not help me at all.
I&rsquo;m definitely outside of my confort zone. It&rsquo;s not a bad thing, it means I am learning. Thats the reason I coached at Rails Girls.</p>

<p>(A fellow coach, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/maunovaha">@maunovaha</a>)</p>

<p>I did not learn new functional programming language or new trick how to trim down a ruby method with ruby&rsquo;s magical syntex.
What I learned was completely non-technical. It reminded me to try to understand people who do not share
my enthusiasm on technology.</p>

<p>Software is written for the people. The better you understand your users,
the better software you are able to build.
When that nasty bug appears requiring only a tiny fix on user interface but heavy refactoring on business logic,
you&rsquo;ll put yourself into your user&rsquo;s shoes and understand that the bug is worth fixing. That is called empathy.</p>

<p>I encourage every programming expert to coach at a programming event aimed for beginners.</p>
