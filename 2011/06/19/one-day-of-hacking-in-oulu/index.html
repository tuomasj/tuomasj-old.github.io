<h1>CSSMesta - One Day of Hacking in Oulu</h1>
<p>I have been talking with <a href="http://www.pumpula.net">my friend</a> about building a small web app for at least six months. The idea has been evolving almost everytime we discussed about it, but it never got any further except few prototypes.</p>

<p>I guess good things need time to develop. Our schedules cleared up for one weekend so the time had come! We decided to do two man hack festival for one day.</p>

<p>Last saturday, we went down to Oulu city centre with our laptops.
We had no plan, except the general idea what we have been discussing. The plan was to find a nice cafe, open our laptops and develop a web app.</p>

<h2>Our Ad-hoc Development Environment</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oulu">Oulu</a> has <a href="http://www.panoulu.net">Panoulu</a>, open wireless network spread across the city. Did I mention it is free? It&rsquo;s completely free. So we had wlan sorted out. And we had 3G as a backup.</p>

<p>As a die-hard Git fan, I have a confession to make. We did not use Git. Instead, we used Dropbox. We had a shared folder where I ran the development server. Both of us edited the files and it worked pretty well. We had just few occasions when editing a file ended up in conflict but they were easy to fix. So this was our development environment:</p>

<p><strong>Dropbox &rarr; Rails (WEBrick) &rarr; Browser</strong></p>

<p>For brief moment, Panoulu did not work for both of us, so then we had this setup:</p>

<p><strong>Dropbox &rarr; Rails (WEBrick) &rarr; Localtunnel &rarr; Browser</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://progrium.com/localtunnel/">Localtunnel</a> is just awesome. It&rsquo;s simple and easy and it just works.</p>

<h2>Mobile Office</h2>

<p>First batch of developing we spent at coffeehouse. Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t remember the name. It is a nice little cafe. The place was quiet, so that&rsquo;s a big plus if you want to do some hacking. Too bad I didn&rsquo;t took any pictures.</p>

<p>For second part, we walked around a bit and saw a cafe called Puistola.
From outside, the place looked nice, so we decided to give it a try.</p>

<p>We took seats by the window and setup our gear:</p>

<p><img src="/images/cssmesta-mobile-office.jpg" title="Our Mobile Office at Puistola Deli" alt="Our mobile office at Puistola" /></p>

<p>Now, that looks pretty awesome! Only downside was the occasional loud noise that came from coffee machines. But overall, it was good place to do some serious developing.</p>

<p>When we do our next tiny hack-festival, Puistola most likely will be one of our destinations.</p>

<h2>The App We Developed</h2>

<p>We built <a href="http://cssmesta.heroku.com">CSSMesta</a>. It&rsquo;s a small webapp for CSS galleries. We provide the markup and you provide the CSS. Go try it, it might even like it! :)</p>

<p>Currently, we are hosting it on Heroku. It&rsquo;s still a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">MVP</a>. If we get positive reaction from the internets, then we have to think about domains, hosting and stuff, but for now we settle on Heroku.</p>

<p>The day was totally fun! Our tiny hack-festival was a success! We managed to make a small web app and it feels just awesome!</p>

<p>I recommend this spending a day this way for everyone!</p>
